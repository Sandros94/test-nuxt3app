# What am I looking at?
This is a small personal sandbox/boilerplate for a minimal nuxt app.
By minimal I mean with the minimum tools I need to fulfill my current projects.


# Old readme
this are lines from the old readme that I need revisit and cleanup

## Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter
Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Production
Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
