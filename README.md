# This README needs an update ðŸ™„

## What am I looking at?

This is a small sandbox/boilerplate for a minimal nuxt app.
By minimal I mean that includes the minimum tools I need to fulfill my current projects.

## Nuxt Modules

This is a list of currently installed modules and future ones that need evaluation and testing:

- [x] [UnoCSS](https://nuxt.com/modules/unocss) - CSS engine.
- [x] [Anu](https://anu-vue.netlify.app/) - Components based on UnoCSS.
- [ ] [Content](https://nuxt.com/modules/content) - Document driven content (mainly for small projects).
- [ ] [Directus](https://nuxt.com/modules/directus) - Connets to a Directus istance (mainly for big projects).
